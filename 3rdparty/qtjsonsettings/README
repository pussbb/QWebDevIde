This is a Qt JSON Parser and serializer.

The API is trivial:
    JsonReader reader;
    reader.parse(jsonString);
    QVariant v = reader.result();

    JsonWriter writer;
    writer.stringify(v);
    QString json = writer.result();

Compilation:
    The code uses QLALR (in Qt respository. $QTDIR/util/qlalr). Just,
    'qlalr json.g' produces the parser 'jsonparser.cpp'. This generated file is
    checked into the respository for convenience, so that the user does
    not need to build qlalr.

Using in external projects:
    Just drop 3 files - src/json.cpp src/json.h src/jsonparser.cpp into your code.
    Add json.cpp to SOURCES and you are good to go. jsonparser.cpp is included by
    json.cpp so you should not add it to SOURCES. You may add json.h to HEADERS but
    it's not necessary since it does not contains any mocable content.
